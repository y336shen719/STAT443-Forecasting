## Problem 4
### (a)
```{R}
library(fpp)
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# plot the series
plot(austa, main="The plot of austa time series", 
     ylab="total international visitors (in millions)")
# plot ACF
acf(austa, main="The ACF plot of austa time series")
# plot PACF
pacf(austa, main="The PACF plot of austa time series")

# comments:
# Based on the time series plot, we found that there is a increasing trend over
# 1980 to 2015, so it is not stationary.
# Based on the ACF plot, we found that ACF has a slow decay and cut off after
# lag7.
# Based on the PACF plot, we found that except significant spike at lag1, other
# spikes stay within the band.
```

```{R}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
# plot difference series
plot(diff(austa), main="The plot of difference series of austa")
# plot its ACF
acf(diff(austa))
# plot its PACF
pacf(diff(austa))

# comments:
# Based on the plot of difference series, there is no obvious trend and it
# looks quite stationary.
# Based on its ACF and PACF plot, almost (except lag0 in ACF) all spikes stay
# within the band, so there is no significant spikes for the first difference
# series.
```

### (b)
```{R}
# How to settled on the model:
# We notice that the first difference series is relative stationary and looks 
# like a white noise process. So we fit a ARIMA(0,1,0) model to the series.
library(astsa)
# forecast 10 steps ahead
model <- sarima.for(austa, n.ahead=10, p=0, d=1, q=0)
model
# construct 95% prediction interval
c <- 1.96
lower_bound <- model$pred-c*model$se
upper_bound <- model$pred+c*model$se
cbind(model$pred,lower_bound, upper_bound)
```

### (c)
```{R}
time.vec <- 1:length(austa)
time.vec2 <- time.vec^2
time.vec3 <- time.vec^3
time.vec4 <- time.vec^4
time.vec5 <- time.vec^5

# fitting models
regression1 <- lm(austa~time.vec, na.action=NULL)
regression2 <- lm(austa~time.vec+time.vec2, na.action=NULL)
regression3 <- lm(austa~time.vec+time.vec2+time.vec3, na.action=NULL)
regression4 <- lm(austa~time.vec+time.vec2+time.vec3+time.vec4, na.action=NULL)
regression5 <- lm(austa~time.vec+time.vec2+time.vec3+time.vec4+time.vec5,
                 na.action=NULL)

# Based on Residual plot
plot(rstudent(regression1))
plot(rstudent(regression2))
plot(rstudent(regression3))
plot(rstudent(regression4))
plot(rstudent(regression5))

# Based on AIC
AIC(regression1)
AIC(regression2)
AIC(regression3)
AIC(regression4)
AIC(regression5)

# fitting trend+noise model:
# Based on the residual plots, we found that there seems to be decreasing trend 
# in regression1 and regression2, and for regression 3,4,5, they all do not have 
# obvious trend.

# Then based on their AIC, we found that model_reg4 has the smallest AIC.
# Therefore, based on both residual plot and AIC, regression4
# (time.vec+time.vec2+time.vec3+time.vec4) is appropriate.
```
```{R}
acf(resid(regression4))
pacf(resid(regression4))
# How to settled on the model:
# Based on the ACF and PACF plot of reg4, we found that its ACF cut off after 
# lag1 and PACF cut off after lag2, so we fit a ARIMA(2,0,1) to the series.
```
```{R}
predict_time = 32:41
predict_data = cbind(time.vec=predict_time,
                     time.vec2=predict_time^2,
                     time.vec3=predict_time^3,
                     time.vec4=predict_time^4)
# forecast 10 steps ahead
model2 <- sarima.for(austa, n.ahead = 10,
                     p=2, d=0, q=1,
                     xreg=model.matrix(regression4)[,-1],
                     newxreg = predict_data)
model2
# construct 95% prediction interval
c <- 1.96
lower_bound <- model2$pred-c*model2$se
upper_bound <- model2$pred+c*model2$se
cbind(model2$pred,lower_bound,upper_bound)
```

### (d)
Difference: The ARIMA forecast is linear trend while the trend+noise forecast 
is non-linear trend. Besides, the prediction interval of trend+noise forecast is 
much narrower then ARIMA forecast. 
Therefore, I think that trend+noise forecast is better. Because the narrow
forecast interval means that the forecast is more accurate.

## Problem 5

```{R}
load("usGNP.RData")
```

### (a)
```{R}
# plot raw data
plot(y, main="Plot of USA GNP time series from 1947 to 2002")
# plot first difference of log time series
plot(diff(log(y)), main="Plot of the first difference of log time series")

# Comments:
# Based on the plot of raw data, we found that there is a very obvious
# increasing trend, so the time series is non-stationary.
# Based on the first difference of log time series, we found that there is no
# obvious trend and seasonality so it looks relative stationary.
# The meaning of first difference of log(y) in real life is GNP's growth rate.
```

### (b)
```{R}
# ACF plot
acf(diff(log(y)), main="Sample ACF plot of first difference of log time series")
# PACF plot
pacf(diff(log(y)), main="Sample PACF plot of first difference of log time series")

# Comments:
# Based on the sample ACF plot, we found that spikes cut off at lag2.
# Based on the sample PACF plot, we found that spikes cut off at lag1.
# Therefore, we suggest an ARIMA(1,1,2) model on the logrithmic data.
```

### (c)
```{R}
library(astsa)
model <- sarima(log(y), p=1, d=1, q=2)
model

# diagnostics:
# Based on plot of standardized residuals, there is no obvious trend, 
# seasonality.
# Based on plot of ACF, except lag0, there is no significant spike. 
# Based on QQplot, most points distribute along qqline roughly, except a 
# few points at two ends.
# Based on LjungBox test, p-value above 0.05 shows that there is no
# evidence to reject hypothesis of white noise.
```

### (d)
```{R}
# simulate ARIMA model
model_sim <- arima.sim(list(order=c(1,1,2),ar=0.2407,ma=c(0.0761, 0.1623)),
                       n=400)
acf(model_sim, main="ACF plot of simulated model")
pacf(model_sim, main="PACF plot of simulated model")

# Comments:
# Based on the ACF plot, the values decay slowly.
# Based on the PACF plot, there are significant spikes at lag1 and lag2.
```

### (e)
```{R}
# forecast of log(GNP)
model_forecast <- sarima.for(log(y), n.ahead = 5, p=1, d=1, q=2,
                             main="Forecast of log(GNP)")
# Switch to forecast of GNP
exp(model_forecast$pred)
# construct 95% forecasted interval
c <- 1.96
# lower bound
lower_bound <- exp(model_forecast$pred-c*model_forecast$se)
# upper bound
upper_bound <- exp(model_forecast$pred+c*model_forecast$se)
# summary
cbind(model_forecast$pred, lower_bound, upper_bound)
```
