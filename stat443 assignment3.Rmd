## Question 3
```{R}
ARMA11 <- arima.sim(model = list(ar=0.4, ma=-0.6), n=60)
```

### (a)
```{R}
library(simts)
plot(theo_acf(ar = 0.4, ma = -0.6), 
              main="Theoreticl ACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=60")
```

### (b)
```{R}
acf(ARMA11, xaxp=c(0, 30, 10), ylab="ACF",
    main="Sample ACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=60",
    type="correlation")

# comments:
# The sample ACF plot has all non-significant lags except lag0, which means that 
# no spike lies outside bounds.
# while the plot of theoreticl ACF has an exponential decay.
# So sample ACF does not mimic the true ACF in great details.
```

### (c)
```{R}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# ACF
acf(ARMA11,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="ACF",type="correlation",
    main="Sample ACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=60")
# PACF
acf(ARMA11,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="PACF",type="partial",
    main="Sample PACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=60")

# comments:
# No, the patterns of sample ACF and PACF cannot help me specify the order.
# Since in both ACF and PACF, almost all lags except lag0 lie within bounds.
```

### (d)
```{R}
ARMA11_d <- arima.sim(model=list(ar=0.4,ma=-0.6),n=36)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# ACF
acf(ARMA11_d,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="ACF",type="correlation",
    main="Sample ACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=36")
# PACF
acf(ARMA11_d,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="PACF",type="partial",
    main="Sample PACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=36")

# comments:
# Compared with theoretical ACF plot, the sample ACF plot has almost all
# non-significant lags except lag0, which means that most spike lies within
# bounds.

# No, the patterns of sample ACF and PACF cannot help me specify the order.
# Since in both ACF and PACF, almost all lags except lag0 lie within bounds.
```


### (e)
```{R}
ARMA11_e <- arima.sim(model=list(ar=0.4,ma=-0.6),n=120)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# ACF
acf(ARMA11_e,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="ACF",type="correlation",
    main="Sample ACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=120")
# PACF
acf(ARMA11_e,xaxp=c(0,30,10),ylab="PACF",type="partial",
    main="Sample PACF of ARMA(1,1) with phi=0.4, theta=0.6, n=120")

# comments:
# Compared with theoretical ACF plot, the sample ACF plot also has a 
# significant spike around lag1. It shows that the correlation around lag1 is 
# relative obvious, which is similar to the theoretical plot. While almost all 
# other lags except lag0, lag1 are non-significant.

# No, the patterns of sample ACF and PACF cannot help me specify the order.
# Since in both ACF and PACF, almost all lags except lag0 lie within bounds.
```

## Question 4
```{R}
library(TSA)
data(robot)
```

### (a)
```{R}
ts.robot <- ts(robot)
plot(ts.robot, ylab="robot",
     xlab="time",main="Time Series Plot for robot")

# comments:
# These data appear to come from a non-stationary process.
# Because it seems that the mean and variance of the process are not constant
# over time. Besides, there seems to be a drop around 200 and 300, which
# can be considered as a sudden change in pattern.
```


### (b)
```{R}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# ACF
acf(ts.robot, ylab="ACF", main="Sample ACF Plot for Robot Time Series")
# PACF
acf(ts.robot, ylab="PACF", type = "partial",
    main="Sample PACF Plot for Robot Time Series")

# comments:
# Based on the sample ACF plot:
# These data appear to come from a non-stationary process since
# the sample ACF fails to die out rapidly as the lags increase
# Based on the sample PACF plot:
# The sample PACF dies out after lag6 roughly, 
# so I propose a AR(6) model.
```


### (c)
```{R}
# Try some different ARIMA models, based on (a)-(b): we consider AR,MA & ARMA.

df

# comments:

# smallest AIC.
```


### (d)
```{R}
AR_fit <- arima(ts.robot,order=c(1,0,0))
AR_fit
```

The estimated model would be written as following and also the estimated noise
variance is 6.482e-06.
$$
(Y_t - 0.0015) = 0.3074(Y_{t-1} - 0.0015) + Z_t
$$

### (e)
```{R}
IMA_fit <-arima(ts.robot,order=c(0,1,1))
IMA_fit
```

The estimated model would be written as following and also the estimated noise
variance is 6.069e-06.
$$
Y_t - Y_{t-1} = Z_t - 0.8713 Z_{t-1}
$$


### (f)
AIC:
Since the AIC of the IMA(1,1) is smaller than the AIC of AR(1), so IMA(1,1) fits
the data better.

other diagnostic methods:
```{R}
# Residual VS. Time
plot(residuals(AR_fit),ylab="Residuals",
     main="Residuals VS. Time for AR(1)",
     type='o')
abline(h=0)
plot(residuals(IMA_fit),ylab="Residuals",
     main="Residuals VS. Time for IMA(1,1)",
     type='o')
abline(h=0)

# Comments:
# Both residual plots support the model, as no obvious trends are present.
```

```{R}
# QQ plot
qqnorm(residuals(AR_fit))
qqline(residuals(AR_fit))
shapiro.test(residuals(AR_fit))
qqnorm(residuals(IMA_fit))
qqline(residuals(IMA_fit))
shapiro.test(residuals(IMA_fit))

# comments:
# In both qq-plots of AR(1) and IMA(1,1), points are lying roughly along the 
# qq-line. And both of their p-values in Shapior test are big, which cannot
# reject the normality hypothesis.
```

```{R}
# ACF of Residuals
acf(residuals(AR_fit), main="ACF of Residuals for AR(1)")
Box.test(residuals(AR_fit),type="Ljung-Box")
acf(residuals(IMA_fit), main="ACF of Residuals for IMA(1,1)")
Box.test(residuals(IMA_fit),type="Ljung-Box")

# comments:
# Both of their p-values in Ljung-Box test are big, which cannot reject the
# independence hypothesis.
# While based on their ACF plots, there are more spikes in AR(1) plot go beyond
# the bounds and most spikes in IMA(1,1) plot except lag10, all stay within
# the bounds.


# Final conclusion:
# Based on AIC and ACF of Residuals, I think that model IMA(1,1) fits data 
# better.
