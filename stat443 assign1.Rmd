### stat443 assignment1 problem 4

## (a)
```{R}
oz <- read.csv("MonthlyOzoneLA.csv", header = FALSE)
oz.ts <- ts(oz, start = c(1955,1), end = c(1972,12), frequency = 12)

# exploratory commands
# class
class(oz.ts)

# starting date
start(oz.ts)

# ending date
end(oz.ts)

# frequency
frequency(oz.ts)
```

\newpage
## (b)
```{R}
# print
print(oz.ts)

# comment on structure
# The structure is a 18 x 12 matrix, with 18 rows as years and 12 columns as months.
```

\newpage
## (c)
```{R}
plot(oz.ts, ylab="Readings of Ozone (pphm)", xaxt="n",
     main = "Averages of hourly readings of Ozone in LA downtown")
axis(1, at = start(time(oz.ts))[1]:end(time(oz.ts))[1], labels = TRUE, las=2)

# period
# The period of the time series is 12.
```

\newpage
## (d)
## Based on visualied time series, it is non-stationary. Because the time
## series has a decreasing trend and seasonal cycle.

\newpage
## (e)
```{R}
agg_oz.ts <- aggregate(oz.ts)
plot(agg_oz.ts, ylab = "Readings of Ozone (pphm)", xaxt="n",
     main="Yearly summary of averages of hourly readings 
     of Ozone in LA downtown")
axis(1, at = start(time(agg_oz.ts))[1]:end(time(agg_oz.ts))[1], 
     labels = TRUE, las=2)

# comment on observation
# I observed that the time series reached its peak in 1956 and reached its bottom in 1971.
# And overall, there is a decreasing trend.
```

\newpage
## (f)
```{R}
boxplot(oz.ts~cycle(oz.ts), xlab="Months", ylab="Readings of Ozone (pphm)",
        main="Monthly summary of averages of hourly readings 
        of Ozone in LA downtown")

# comment on observation
# I observed that there is seasonal effect, the values of readings are relative
# high for 6-10 (summer) while the values are relative low for 1-3,12 (winter).
```

\newpage
## (g)
```{R}
plot(decompose(oz.ts))

# comment on observation
# Based on 'trend' part, I found that there is a decreasing trend.
# Based on 'seasonal' part, I found that there is a seasonal cycle.
# Based on 'random' part, I found that the variation between 1955 and 1960
# are relative large, while the variation between 1960 and 1972 are small.
